# New Tab Sync Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
It is intended to be an example of how the wrapStore in the background script can be out of sync with the proxy store on user facing scripts (content scripts, newtab, etc.)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Load the subsequent build folder as a development extension.
